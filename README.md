# k8s-learning-lab

This repository is my personal Kubernetes learning lab.

I am learning Kubernetes from the official documentation and, in parallel, creating practical YAML manifests for every concept I study. The goal of this repo is to turn theory into hands-on understanding and build a strong foundation in Kubernetes.

This is an evolving repository and will grow as I continue learning and experimenting with Kubernetes.
